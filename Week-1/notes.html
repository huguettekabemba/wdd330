        <p>In this weeks studies I learned about Node.js and NPM. Node.js and npm 
            (short for Node Package Manager) are both important components in the 
            development of JavaScript applications, but they serve different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside 
            of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by
            Google Chrome. Node.js is often used for server-side applications, as it provides 
            a way to write server-side code in JavaScript, making it possible to use a single 
            language for both client-side and server-side development. Node.js includes a built-in 
            package manager called npm, which allows us to easily install and manage dependencies
            for our Node.js projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            npm, on the other hand, is a package manager specifically designed for Node.js. 
            It allows us to install and manage packages (i.e., libraries, frameworks, and tools) 
            that can be used in our Node.js projects. npm provides a central repository where we 
            can find and download packages, and it also includes features for managing dependencies,
            versioning, and publishing our own packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside 
            of a web browser, while npm is a package manager specifically designed for Node.js that allows
            us to easily install and manage packages for our Node.js projects.
