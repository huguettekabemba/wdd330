        <p>
            This week we learned about testing and debugging in Javascript. There are different
            tpyes of errors which will determine how we go about the process. Here are the types
            of errors you can encounter:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Syntax Errors - errors that are detected by the compiler</li>
            <li>Runtime Errors - errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally</li>
            <li>Logic Errors - occer when a program does not perform the way it was intended to</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            It's important to be able to recognize what errors we have so that we can properly
            test and debug them.
        </p>
        <h3>Concole.log()</h3>
        <p>
            One debugging method is <i>console.log()</i>. Using this allows us to display a value in
            the console so we can see what value is being claculated and can see if it's our desired outcome.</p>
        <p>
            a = 5; <br>
            b = 6; <br>
            c = a + b; <br>
            console.log(c); <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            By doing this we will see that c is equal to 11 and and know whether or not our program is working
            correctly.
        </p>
        <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
        <p>
            Another method is by setting breakpoints. We can set breakpoints and when our code runs into one,
            it will stop executing and we can see the current values. We can then resume the program.
        </p>
        <h3>Debugger Keyword</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>debugger</i> keyword is similar to settting a breakpoint. It stops the execution of
            the program where it is placed before continuing.
        </p>
        <p>
            var x = 15 * 5; <br>
            debugger; <br>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
        </p>
