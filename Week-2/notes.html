        <p>
            Functions are procedures or routines that perform certain tasks. You get to decide what it is they do and
            how they do it. I have had some trouble understanding the other syntaxes to create functions is Javascript
            so I will try and explain them here. Below are three sepereate ways of how to create the same functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            function add() {
            let number1 = document.getElementById('number1').value;
            let number2 = document.getElementById('number2').value;

            document.getElementById('plus').innerHTML = Number(number1) + Number(number2);
            }
            <br>
            <br>
            const add = funtion addNumbers() {
            let number1 = document.getElementById('number1').value;
            let number2 = document.getElementById('number2').value;

            document.getElementById('plus').innerHTML = Number(number1) + Number(number2);
            }
            <br>
            <br>
            
            const add = () => {
                let number1 = document.getElementById('number1').value;
                let number2 = document.getElementById('number2').value;
    
                document.getElementById('plus').innerHTML = Number(number1) + Number(number2);
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            The functions above look fairly similar but have their differences. I understood the first one easily
            because it was the first one I learned. The second one helps me to understand the third. For the second
            and thrid forms of the functions, you do not call the function itself, rather you call the const assigned
            to the function. The ones that make the most sense to me are the first and the third. I do not understand
            why you would name a function if you wont be referencing that name later on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something I found very interesting was the use of methods. Methods are functions that are built in to
            Javascript. Therefore, you do not need to code them, instead, you just call them. I have used many before
            life console.log and Math.pow but was unaware of the many that there are. Below I will include some that
            can be used to manipulate and change arrays. the .push method can add something to the end of and array
            while the .pop method returns and and removes the last value in the array referenced.
        </p>
        <p>
            let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
            sequence.push(4);
            sequence.push(5);
            console.log(sequence);
            // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            console.log(sequence.pop());
            // → 5
            console.log(sequence);
            // → [1, 2, 3, 4]
        </p>
